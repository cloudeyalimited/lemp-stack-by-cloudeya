Why use Cloudeya Certified Apps?

Cloudeya certified images are always up-to-date, secure, and built to work right out of the box.

Cloudeya packages applications following industry standards, and continuously monitors all components and libraries for vulnerabilities and application updates. When any security threat or update is identified, Cloudeya automatically repackages the applications and pushes the latest versions to the cloud marketplaces.

## Features

LEMP Stack by Cloudeya is pre-configured with the following technologies:

1. **Nginx**: is an open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.
2. **Certbot**: is EFF's tool to obtain certs from Let's Encrypt and (optionally) auto-enable HTTPS on your server.
3. **Amazon Linux 2023** or **Ubuntu 24.04**.
4. **PHP 8**: drops many [deprecated functions](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.deprecated.php) in favor of [new, modernized features](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.new-features.php). Additionally, [PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) will stop receiving security updates on November 28, 2022.
5. **MySQL (MariaDB)**: is an open source relational database management system (DBMS) that is a compatible drop-in replacement for the widely used MySQL database technology.
6. **Composer**: helps you declare, manage, and install dependencies of PHP projects.
7. **Node.js**: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing you to run JavaScript on the server-side.
